# Connection üì≥

Connection is a software that allows users to track different modems (or routers) on the same network or server. Users can track, and analyze the performance of each router/modem with latency returns, network returns, ip address validations, and more! 

Connection brings a new, innovative, and easy approach to analyze network servers. If a network is a slow for example, users can analyze network return times based on links of every two modems connected (portrayed by the software) and make appropiate decisions based on the analysis. 

# How it works üî®

Users will first be prompted to type a certain command after the `:` (colon). Commands vary from: 
 - `/add_modem`: Allows the user to add a modem to the software
 - `/register`: Registers a certain modem (chosen by the user) onto the network itself, where further analysis of both the modem and the network in general can be done.
 - `/check_link`: Verifies if there is a link between two routers/modems on the network 
 - `/delete`: Delete's a certain modem/router from the network 
 - `/view_modems`: Allows the user to view all the modems on the network
 - `/ip_validation`: Allows the user to check if their Ip prompted is fake or is registered under a modem on the server
 - `/check_total_latency`: Returns the total latency of the network 
 - `/check_ip`: Checks if a prompted ip is the same ip of the prompted modem/router on the network. 
 - `/quit`: Quits the Software 

*Note*: If there the software returns that `The modem is not registered` or `The modem is not on the software`, the user must register the modem on the software with `/register`. If again the command (`/register`) returns `The modem does not seem to be added into the software`, the user must add the modem again by using the command `/add_modem`.

# More Information üìö

If none of the commands listed above are typed on the software, the software will return a statement `That command does not seem to be valid` and the user will be prompted again until the the user types in a valid command. 

The ip addresses that are inputted into the software turn into *hashcodes* for security and safety. Hence, everytime an ip addresses are inputted, they become hashcodes and the software compares hashcodes instead of ip addresses. 

The software has two underlying arrays (`registered_modems` and `unregistered_modems`) that keep track of the modems that are registered and unregistered on the network. This allows for better efficiency of the program for functions like `/delete`, `/view_modems`, and etc. 

For the functions that involve the ip address (`/check_ip`, and `ip_validation`), the *Naive Search Algorithm* is implemented to keep track of each letter of between the prompted ip from the user and the actual ip of the modem. If the prompted ip matches the actual ip of the modem, the algorithm will return a list of indices where the match was found. 

# Technical Information üîå

The *Naive Search Algorithm* has a time complexity of `O(n + k)` and space complexity of `O(n)` 

The `hashlib` library was used to hash the ip addresses prompted.

Time Comlexity of each command varies. However, general case of all commands are `O(N)`

The *Graph* data structure was used for the underlying network itself. The graph converts each modem into a vertex, and then connects each modem prompted with a *time in miliseconds* as the edge between the two vertices. This allows the whole network to be seen as a *spider-web* or a *mind-map*
