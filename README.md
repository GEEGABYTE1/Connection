# Connection üì≥

Connection is a software that allows users to track different modems (or routers) on the same network or server. Users can track, and analyze the performance of each router/modem with latency returns, network returns, ip address validations, and more! 

Connection brings a new, innovative, and easy approach to analyze network servers. If a network is a slow for example, users can analyze network return times based on links of every two modems connected (portrayed by the software) and make appropiate decisions based on the analysis. 

# How it works

Users will first be prompted to type a certain command after the `:` (colon). Commands vary from: 
 - `/add_modem`: Allows the user to add a modem to the software
 - `/register`: Registers a certain modem (chosen by the user) onto the network itself, where further analysis of both the modem and the network in general can be done.
 - `/check_link`: Verifies if there is a link between two routers/modems on the network 
 - `/delete`: Delete's a certain modem/router from the network 
 - `/view_modems`: Allows the user to view all the modems on the network
 - `/ip_validation`: Allows the user to check if their Ip prompted is fake or is registered under a modem on the server
 - `/check_total_latency`: Returns the total latency of the network 
 - `/check_ip`: Checks if a prompted ip is the same ip of the prompted modem/router on the network.
